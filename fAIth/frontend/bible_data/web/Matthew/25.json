    "1": "<span class=\"wj\">“Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. </span>",
    "2": "<span class=\"wj\">Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. </span>",
    "3": "<span class=\"wj\">Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them, </span>",
    "4": "<span class=\"wj\">but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. </span>",
    "5": "<span class=\"wj\">Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept. </span>",
    "6": "<span class=\"wj\">But at midnight there was a cry, ‘Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!’ </span>",
    "7": "<span class=\"wj\">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</span>",
    "8": "<span class=\"wj\">The foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’ </span>",
    "9": "<span class=\"wj\">But the wise answered, saying, ‘What if there isn’t enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.’ </span>",
    "10": "<span class=\"wj\">While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut. </span>",
    "11": "<span class=\"wj\">Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open to us.’ </span>",
    "12": "<span class=\"wj\">But he answered, ‘Most certainly I tell you, I don’t know you.’ </span>",
    "13": "<span class=\"wj\">Watch therefore, for you don’t know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.</span>",
    "14": "<span class=\"wj\">“For it is like a man going into another country, who called his own servants and entrusted his goods to them. </span>",
    "15": "<span class=\"wj\">To one he gave five talents,</span> <span class=\"wj\">to another two, to another one, to each according to his own ability. Then he went on his journey. </span>",
    "16": "<span class=\"wj\">Immediately he who received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents. </span>",
    "17": "<span class=\"wj\">In the same way, he also who got the two gained another two. </span>",
    "18": "<span class=\"wj\">But he who received the one talent went away and dug in the earth and hid his lord’s money.</span>",
    "19": "<span class=\"wj\">“Now after a long time the lord of those servants came, and settled accounts with them. </span>",
    "20": "<span class=\"wj\">He who received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, ‘Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents in addition to them.’</span>",
    "21": "<span class=\"wj\">“His lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.’</span>",
    "22": "<span class=\"wj\">“He also who got the two talents came and said, ‘Lord, you delivered to me two talents. Behold, I have gained another two talents in addition to them.’ </span>",
    "23": "<span class=\"wj\">“His lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things. I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.’</span>",
    "24": "<span class=\"wj\">“He also who had received the one talent came and said, ‘Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you didn’t sow, and gathering where you didn’t scatter. </span>",
    "25": "<span class=\"wj\">I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.’</span>",
    "26": "<span class=\"wj\">“But his lord answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didn’t sow, and gather where I didn’t scatter. </span>",
    "27": "<span class=\"wj\">You ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest. </span>",
    "28": "<span class=\"wj\">Take away therefore the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. </span>",
    "29": "<span class=\"wj\">For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have abundance, but from him who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away. </span>",
    "30": "<span class=\"wj\">Throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’</span>",
    "31": "<span class=\"wj\">“But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory. </span>",
    "32": "<span class=\"wj\">Before him all the nations will be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. </span>",
    "33": "<span class=\"wj\">He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. </span>",
    "34": "<span class=\"wj\">Then the King will tell those on his right hand, ‘Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; </span>",
    "35": "<span class=\"wj\">for I was hungry and you gave me food to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a stranger and you took me in. </span>",
    "36": "<span class=\"wj\">I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me.’</span>",
    "37": "<span class=\"wj\">“Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you a drink? </span>",
    "38": "<span class=\"wj\">When did we see you as a stranger and take you in, or naked and clothe you? </span>",
    "39": "<span class=\"wj\">When did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?’</span>",
    "40": "<span class=\"wj\">“The King will answer them, ‘Most certainly I tell you, because you did it to one of the least of these my brothers,</span> <span class=\"wj\">you did it to me.’ </span>",
    "41": "<span class=\"wj\">Then he will say also to those on the left hand, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels; </span>",
    "42": "<span class=\"wj\">for I was hungry, and you didn’t give me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink; </span>",
    "43": "<span class=\"wj\">I was a stranger, and you didn’t take me in; naked, and you didn’t clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you didn’t visit me.’</span>",
    "44": "<span class=\"wj\">“Then they will also answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and didn’t help you?’</span>",
    "45": "<span class=\"wj\">“Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Most certainly I tell you, because you didn’t do it to one of the least of these, you didn’t do it to me.’ </span>",
    "46": "<span class=\"wj\">These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”</span>"
