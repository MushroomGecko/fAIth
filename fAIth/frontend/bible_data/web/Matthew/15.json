    "1": "Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,",
    "2": "“Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they eat bread.”",
    "3": "He answered them, <span class=\"wj\">“Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition? </span>",
    "4": "<span class=\"wj\">For God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’</span> <span class=\"wj\">and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’</span>",
    "5": "<span class=\"wj\">But you say, ‘Whoever may tell his father or his mother, “Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,” </span>",
    "6": "<span class=\"wj\">he shall not honor his father or mother.’ You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition. </span>",
    "7": "<span class=\"wj\">You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</span>",
    "8": "<span class=\"wj\">‘These people draw near to me with their mouth,</span> <span class=\"wj\">and honor me with their lips;</span> <span class=\"wj\">but their heart is far from me.</span>",
    "9": "<span class=\"wj\">And they worship me in vain,</span> <span class=\"wj\">teaching as doctrine rules made by men.’ ”</span>",
    "10": "He summoned the multitude, and said to them, <span class=\"wj\">“Hear, and understand. </span>",
    "11": "<span class=\"wj\">That which enters into the mouth doesn’t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.”</span>",
    "12": "Then the disciples came and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?”",
    "13": "But he answered, <span class=\"wj\">“Every plant which my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be uprooted. </span>",
    "14": "<span class=\"wj\">Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit.”</span>",
    "15": "Peter answered him, “Explain the parable to us.”",
    "16": "So Jesus said, <span class=\"wj\">“Do you also still not understand? </span>",
    "17": "<span class=\"wj\">Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly and then out of the body? </span>",
    "18": "<span class=\"wj\">But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man. </span>",
    "19": "<span class=\"wj\">For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies. </span>",
    "20": "<span class=\"wj\">These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn’t defile the man.”</span>",
    "21": "Jesus went out from there and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon.",
    "22": "Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!”",
    "23": "But he answered her not a word. His disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away; for she cries after us.”",
    "24": "But he answered, <span class=\"wj\">“I wasn’t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”</span>",
    "25": "But she came and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, help me.”",
    "26": "But he answered, <span class=\"wj\">“It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”</span>",
    "27": "But she said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”",
    "28": "Then Jesus answered her, <span class=\"wj\">“Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.”</span> And her daughter was healed from that hour.",
    "29": "Jesus departed from there and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up on the mountain and sat there.",
    "30": "Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them,",
    "31": "so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, the injured healed, the lame walking, and the blind seeing—and they glorified the God of Israel.",
    "32": "Jesus summoned his disciples and said, <span class=\"wj\">“I have compassion on the multitude, because they have continued with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way.” </span>",
    "33": "The disciples said to him, “Where could we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?”",
    "34": "Jesus said to them, <span class=\"wj\">“How many loaves do you have?”</span> They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”",
    "35": "He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;",
    "36": "and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.",
    "37": "They all ate and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.",
    "38": "Those who ate were four thousand men, in addition to women and children.",
    "39": "Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala."
