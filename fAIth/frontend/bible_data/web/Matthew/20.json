    "1": "<span class=\"wj\">“For the Kingdom of Heaven is like a man who was the master of a household, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. </span>",
    "2": "<span class=\"wj\">When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius</span> <span class=\"wj\">a day, he sent them into his vineyard. </span>",
    "3": "<span class=\"wj\">He went out about the third hour,</span> <span class=\"wj\">and saw others standing idle in the marketplace. </span>",
    "4": "<span class=\"wj\">He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.’ So they went their way. </span>",
    "5": "<span class=\"wj\">Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour,</span> <span class=\"wj\">and did likewise. </span>",
    "6": "<span class=\"wj\">About the eleventh hour</span> <span class=\"wj\">he went out and found others standing idle. He said to them, ‘Why do you stand here all day idle?’ </span>",
    "7": "<span class=\"wj\">“They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’</span> <span class=\"wj\">“He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and you will receive whatever is right.’ </span>",
    "8": "<span class=\"wj\">“When evening had come, the lord of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last to the first.’</span>",
    "9": "<span class=\"wj\">“When those who were hired at about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius. </span>",
    "10": "<span class=\"wj\">When the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise each received a denarius. </span>",
    "11": "<span class=\"wj\">When they received it, they murmured against the master of the household, </span>",
    "12": "<span class=\"wj\">saying, ‘These last have spent one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat!’ </span>",
    "13": "<span class=\"wj\">“But he answered one of them, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Didn’t you agree with me for a denarius? </span>",
    "14": "<span class=\"wj\">Take that which is yours, and go your way. It is my desire to give to this last just as much as to you. </span>",
    "15": "<span class=\"wj\">Isn’t it lawful for me to do what I want to with what I own? Or is your eye evil, because I am good?’ </span>",
    "16": "<span class=\"wj\">So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few are chosen.”</span>",
    "17": "As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,",

    "19": "<span class=\"wj\">and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock, to scourge, and to crucify; and the third day he will be raised up.”</span>",
    "20": "Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, kneeling and asking a certain thing of him.",
    "21": "He said to her, <span class=\"wj\">“What do you want?”</span> She said to him, “Command that these, my two sons, may sit, one on your right hand and one on your left hand, in your Kingdom.”",
    "22": "But Jesus answered, <span class=\"wj\">“You don’t know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?”</span> They said to him, “We are able.”",
    "23": "He said to them, <span class=\"wj\">“You will indeed drink my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give, but it is for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”</span>",
    "24": "When the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers.",
    "25": "But Jesus summoned them, and said, <span class=\"wj\">“You know that the rulers of the nations lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. </span>",

    "27": "<span class=\"wj\">Whoever desires to be first among you shall be your bondservant, </span>",
    "28": "<span class=\"wj\">even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”</span>",
    "29": "As they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.",
    "30": "Behold, two blind men sitting by the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!”",
    "31": "The multitude rebuked them, telling them that they should be quiet, but they cried out even more, “Lord, have mercy on us, you son of David!”",
    "32": "Jesus stood still and called them, and asked, <span class=\"wj\">“What do you want me to do for you?”</span>",
    "33": "They told him, “Lord, that our eyes may be opened.”",
    "34": "Jesus, being moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received their sight, and they followed him."
