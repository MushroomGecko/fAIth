    "4": "<span class=\"wj\">Or how will you tell your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye,’ and behold, the beam is in your own eye? </span>",
    "5": "<span class=\"wj\">You hypocrite! First remove the beam out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother’s eye.</span>",
