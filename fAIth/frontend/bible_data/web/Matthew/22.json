    "2": "<span class=\"wj\">“The Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who made a wedding feast for his son, </span>",
    "3": "<span class=\"wj\">and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come. </span>",
    "4": "<span class=\"wj\">Again he sent out other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “Behold, I have prepared my dinner. My cattle and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding feast!” ’ </span>",
    "5": "<span class=\"wj\">But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise; </span>",
    "6": "<span class=\"wj\">and the rest grabbed his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them. </span>",
    "7": "<span class=\"wj\">When the king heard that, he was angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.</span>",
    "8": "<span class=\"wj\">“Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding is ready, but those who were invited weren’t worthy. </span>",
    "9": "<span class=\"wj\">Go therefore to the intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the wedding feast.’ </span>",
    "10": "<span class=\"wj\">Those servants went out into the highways and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. The wedding was filled with guests. </span>",
    "11": "<span class=\"wj\">“But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who didn’t have on wedding clothing, </span>",
    "12": "<span class=\"wj\">and he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing?’ He was speechless. </span>",
    "13": "<span class=\"wj\">Then the king said to the servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and throw him into the outer darkness. That is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.’ </span>",
    "14": "<span class=\"wj\">For many are called, but few chosen.”</span>",
    "15": "Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might entrap him in his talk.",
    "16": "They sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are honest, and teach the way of God in truth, no matter whom you teach; for you aren’t partial to anyone.",

    "18": "But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, <span class=\"wj\">“Why do you test me, you hypocrites? </span>",
    "19": "<span class=\"wj\">Show me the tax money.”</span> They brought to him a denarius.",
    "20": "He asked them, <span class=\"wj\">“Whose is this image and inscription?”</span>",
    "21": "They said to him, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, <span class=\"wj\">“Give therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”</span>",

    "26": "In the same way, the second also, and the third, to the seventh.",
    "27": "After them all, the woman died.",
    "28": "In the resurrection therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her.”",
    "29": "But Jesus answered them, <span class=\"wj\">“You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. </span>",
    "30": "<span class=\"wj\">For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like God’s angels in heaven. </span>",
    "31": "<span class=\"wj\">But concerning the resurrection of the dead, haven’t you read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, </span>",
    "32": "<span class=\"wj\">‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?</span> <span class=\"wj\">God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”</span>",
    "33": "When the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.",
    "34": "But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered themselves together.",
    "35": "One of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing him.",
    "36": "“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?”",
    "37": "Jesus said to him, <span class=\"wj\">“ ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’</span>",
    "38": "<span class=\"wj\">This is the first and great commandment. </span>",
    "39": "<span class=\"wj\">A second likewise is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’</span>",

    "44": "<span class=\"wj\">‘The Lord said to my Lord,</span> <span class=\"wj\">sit on my right hand,</span> <span class=\"wj\">until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet’?</span>",
    "45": "<span class=\"wj\">“If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?”</span>",
