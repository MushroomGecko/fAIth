    "2": "Now the names of the twelve apostles are these. The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother; James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother;",
    "3": "Philip; Bartholomew; Thomas; Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, who was also called Thaddaeus;",
    "4": "Simon the Zealot; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.",
    "5": "Jesus sent these twelve out and commanded them, saying, <span class=\"wj\">“Don’t go among the Gentiles, and don’t enter into any city of the Samaritans. </span>",
    "6": "<span class=\"wj\">Rather, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. </span>",
    "7": "<span class=\"wj\">As you go, preach, saying, ‘The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!’ </span>",
    "8": "<span class=\"wj\">Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers,</span> <span class=\"wj\">and cast out demons. Freely you received, so freely give. </span>",
    "9": "<span class=\"wj\">Don’t take any gold, silver, or brass in your money belts. </span>",
    "10": "<span class=\"wj\">Take no bag for your journey, neither two coats, nor sandals, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his food. </span>",
    "11": "<span class=\"wj\">Into whatever city or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy, and stay there until you go on. </span>",
    "12": "<span class=\"wj\">As you enter into the household, greet it. </span>",
    "13": "<span class=\"wj\">If the household is worthy, let your peace come on it, but if it isn’t worthy, let your peace return to you. </span>",
    "14": "<span class=\"wj\">Whoever doesn’t receive you or hear your words, as you go out of that house or that city, shake the dust off your feet. </span>",
    "15": "<span class=\"wj\">Most certainly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.</span>",
    "16": "<span class=\"wj\">“Behold, I send you out as sheep among wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves. </span>",
    "17": "<span class=\"wj\">But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you. </span>",
    "18": "<span class=\"wj\">Yes, and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations. </span>",
    "19": "<span class=\"wj\">But when they deliver you up, don’t be anxious how or what you will say, for it will be given you in that hour what you will say. </span>",
    "20": "<span class=\"wj\">For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.</span>",
    "21": "<span class=\"wj\">“Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death. </span>",

    "25": "<span class=\"wj\">It is enough for the disciple that he be like his teacher, and the servant like his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul,</span> <span class=\"wj\">how much more those of his household! </span>",
    "26": "<span class=\"wj\">Therefore don’t be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. </span>",
    "27": "<span class=\"wj\">What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim on the housetops. </span>",
    "28": "<span class=\"wj\">Don’t be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.</span>",

    "30": "<span class=\"wj\">But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. </span>",
    "31": "<span class=\"wj\">Therefore don’t be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows. </span>",
    "32": "<span class=\"wj\">Everyone therefore who confesses me before men, I will also confess him before my Father who is in heaven. </span>",
    "33": "<span class=\"wj\">But whoever denies me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in heaven.</span>",
    "34": "<span class=\"wj\">“Don’t think that I came to send peace on the earth. I didn’t come to send peace, but a sword. </span>",
    "35": "<span class=\"wj\">For I came to set a man at odds against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. </span>",
    "36": "<span class=\"wj\">A man’s foes will be those of his own household.</span>",
    "37": "<span class=\"wj\">He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me isn’t worthy of me. </span>",
    "38": "<span class=\"wj\">He who doesn’t take his cross and follow after me isn’t worthy of me. </span>",
    "39": "<span class=\"wj\">He who seeks his life will lose it; and he who loses his life for my sake will find it. </span>",
    "40": "<span class=\"wj\">“He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me. </span>",
    "41": "<span class=\"wj\">He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward. He who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man’s reward. </span>",
    "42": "<span class=\"wj\">Whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, most certainly I tell you, he will in no way lose his reward.”</span>"
