    "1": "Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that his time had come that he would depart from this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.",
    "2": "During supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him,",
    "3": "Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he came from God and was going to God,",
    "4": "arose from supper, and laid aside his outer garments. He took a towel and wrapped a towel around his waist.",
    "5": "Then he poured water into the basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him.",
    "6": "Then he came to Simon Peter. He said to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?”",
    "7": "Jesus answered him, <span class=\"wj\">“You don’t know what I am doing now, but you will understand later.”</span>",
    "8": "Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet!” Jesus answered him, <span class=\"wj\">“If I don’t wash you, you have no part with me.” </span>",
    "9": "Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!”",
    "10": "Jesus said to him, <span class=\"wj\">“Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed, but is completely clean. You are clean, but not all of you.” </span>",
    "11": "For he knew him who would betray him; therefore he said, <span class=\"wj\">“You are not all clean.”</span>",
    "12": "So when he had washed their feet, put his outer garment back on, and sat down again, he said to them, <span class=\"wj\">“Do you know what I have done to you? </span>",
    "13": "<span class=\"wj\">You call me, ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord.’ You say so correctly, for so I am. </span>",
    "14": "<span class=\"wj\">If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet. </span>",
    "15": "<span class=\"wj\">For I have given you an example, that you should also do as I have done to you. </span>",
    "16": "<span class=\"wj\">Most certainly I tell you, a servant is not greater than his lord, neither is one who is sent greater than he who sent him. </span>",
    "17": "<span class=\"wj\">If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them. </span>",
    "18": "<span class=\"wj\">I don’t speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, ‘He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.’</span>",
    "19": "<span class=\"wj\">From now on, I tell you before it happens, that when it happens, you may believe that I am he. </span>",
    "20": "<span class=\"wj\">Most certainly I tell you, he who receives whomever I send, receives me; and he who receives me, receives him who sent me.”</span>",
    "21": "When Jesus had said this, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, <span class=\"wj\">“Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.”</span>",

    "26": "Jesus therefore answered, <span class=\"wj\">“It is he to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it.”</span> So when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.",
    "27": "After the piece of bread, then Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him, <span class=\"wj\">“What you do, do quickly.”</span>",
    "28": "Now nobody at the table knew why he said this to him.",
    "29": "For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus said to him, “Buy what things we need for the feast,” or that he should give something to the poor.",
    "30": "Therefore having received that morsel, he went out immediately. It was night.",
    "31": "When he had gone out, Jesus said, <span class=\"wj\">“Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him. </span>",
