    "2": "<span class=\"wj\">even as you gave him authority over all flesh, so he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him. </span>",
    "3": "<span class=\"wj\">This is eternal life, that they should know you, the only true God, and him whom you sent, Jesus Christ. </span>",
    "4": "<span class=\"wj\">I glorified you on the earth. I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do. </span>",
    "5": "<span class=\"wj\">Now, Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed. </span>",
    "6": "<span class=\"wj\">“I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours, and you have given them to me. They have kept your word. </span>",

    "12": "<span class=\"wj\">While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name. I have kept those whom you have given me. None of them is lost except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. </span>",
    "13": "<span class=\"wj\">But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves. </span>",
    "14": "<span class=\"wj\">I have given them your word. The world hated them because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. </span>",

    "17": "<span class=\"wj\">Sanctify them in your truth. Your word is truth.</span>",

    "24": "<span class=\"wj\">Father, I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am, that they may see my glory which you have given me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world. </span>",
    "25": "<span class=\"wj\">Righteous Father, the world hasn’t known you, but I knew you; and these knew that you sent me. </span>",
    "26": "<span class=\"wj\">I made known to them your name, and will make it known; that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I in them.”</span>"
