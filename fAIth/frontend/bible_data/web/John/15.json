    "3": "<span class=\"wj\">You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to you. </span>",
    "4": "<span class=\"wj\">Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch can’t bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me. </span>",
    "5": "<span class=\"wj\">I am the vine. You are the branches. He who remains in me and I in him bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. </span>",
    "6": "<span class=\"wj\">If a man doesn’t remain in me, he is thrown out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them, throw them into the fire, and they are burned. </span>",

    "13": "<span class=\"wj\">Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends. </span>",
    "14": "<span class=\"wj\">You are my friends if you do whatever I command you. </span>",
    "15": "<span class=\"wj\">No longer do I call you servants, for the servant doesn’t know what his lord does. But I have called you friends, for everything that I heard from my Father, I have made known to you. </span>",
    "16": "<span class=\"wj\">You didn’t choose me, but I chose you and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name, he may give it to you.</span>",

    "24": "<span class=\"wj\">If I hadn’t done among them the works which no one else did, they wouldn’t have had sin. But now they have seen and also hated both me and my Father. </span>",
    "25": "<span class=\"wj\">But this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law, ‘They hated me without a cause.’</span>",
