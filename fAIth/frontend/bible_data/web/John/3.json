    "2": "He came to Jesus by night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him.”",
    "3": "Jesus answered him, <span class=\"wj\">“Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born anew, </span> <span class=\"wj\">he can’t see God’s Kingdom.”</span>",
    "4": "Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?”",
    "5": "Jesus answered, <span class=\"wj\">“Most certainly I tell you, unless one is born of water and Spirit, he can’t enter into God’s Kingdom.</span>",
    "6": "<span class=\"wj\">That which is born of the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit. </span>",
    "7": "<span class=\"wj\">Don’t marvel that I said to you, ‘You must be born anew.’ </span>",
    "8": "<span class=\"wj\">The wind</span> <span class=\"wj\">blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don’t know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.”</span>",

    "10": "Jesus answered him, <span class=\"wj\">“Are you the teacher of Israel, and don’t understand these things? </span>",
    "11": "<span class=\"wj\">Most certainly I tell you, we speak that which we know and testify of that which we have seen, and you don’t receive our witness. </span>",
    "12": "<span class=\"wj\">If I told you earthly things and you don’t believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things? </span>",
    "13": "<span class=\"wj\">No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven. </span>",

    "15": "<span class=\"wj\">that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life. </span>",
    "16": "<span class=\"wj\">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only born</span> <span class=\"wj\">Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life. </span>",
    "17": "<span class=\"wj\">For God didn’t send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him. </span>",
    "18": "<span class=\"wj\">He who believes in him is not judged. He who doesn’t believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only born Son of God. </span>",
    "19": "<span class=\"wj\">This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were evil. </span>",
    "20": "<span class=\"wj\">For everyone who does evil hates the light and doesn’t come to the light, lest his works would be exposed. </span>",
    "21": "<span class=\"wj\">But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in God.”</span>",

    "32": "What he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one receives his witness.",
    "33": "He who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true.",
    "34": "For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives the Spirit without measure.",
    "35": "The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.",
    "36": "One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one who disobeys the Son won’t see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.”"
