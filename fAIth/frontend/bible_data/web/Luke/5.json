    "8": "But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.”",
    "9": "For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which they had caught;",
    "10": "and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Jesus said to Simon, <span class=\"wj\">“Don’t be afraid. From now on you will be catching people alive.”</span>",

    "16": "But he withdrew himself into the desert and prayed.",
    "17": "On one of those days, he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was with him to heal them.",

    "22": "But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, <span class=\"wj\">“Why are you reasoning so in your hearts? </span>",
    "23": "<span class=\"wj\">Which is easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Arise and walk’? </span>",
    "24": "<span class=\"wj\">But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,”</span> he said to the paralyzed man, <span class=\"wj\">“I tell you, arise, take up your cot, and go to your house.”</span>",
