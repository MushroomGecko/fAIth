    "11": "They asked him, saying, “Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”",
    "12": "He said to them, <span class=\"wj\">“Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things. How is it written about the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be despised? </span>",

    "33": "He came to Capernaum, and when he was in the house he asked them, <span class=\"wj\">“What were you arguing among yourselves on the way?”</span>",
    "34": "But they were silent, for they had disputed with one another on the way about who was the greatest.",
    "35": "He sat down and called the twelve; and he said to them, <span class=\"wj\">“If any man wants to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.”</span>",
