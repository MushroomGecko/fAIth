    "4": "<span class=\"wj\">Again, he sent another servant to them; and they threw stones at him, wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated. </span>",
    "5": "<span class=\"wj\">Again he sent another, and they killed him, and many others, beating some, and killing some. </span>",
    "6": "<span class=\"wj\">Therefore still having one, his beloved son, he sent him last to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ </span>",
    "7": "<span class=\"wj\">But those farmers said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’ </span>",
    "8": "<span class=\"wj\">They took him, killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard. </span>",
    "9": "<span class=\"wj\">What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others. </span>",
