    "header_1": "The Parable of the Persistent Widow",
    "1": "Then Jesus told them a parable about their need to pray at all times and not lose heart:",
    "2": "<span class=\"wj\">“In a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected men.</span>",
    "3": "<span class=\"wj\">And there was a widow in that town who kept appealing to him, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.'</span>",
    "4": "<span class=\"wj\">For a while he refused, but later he said to himself, ‘Though I neither fear God nor respect men,</span>",
    "5": "<span class=\"wj\">yet because this widow keeps pestering me, I will give her justice. Then she will stop wearing me out with her perpetual requests.' ”</span>",
    "6": "And the Lord said, <span class=\"wj\">“Listen to the words of the unjust judge.</span>",
    "7": "<span class=\"wj\">Will not God bring about justice for His elect who cry out to Him day and night? Will He continue to defer their help?</span>",
    "8": "<span class=\"wj\">I tell you, He will promptly carry out justice on their behalf. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on earth?”</span>",
    "header_2": "The Pharisee and the Tax Collector",
    "9": "To some who trusted in their own righteousness and viewed others with contempt, He also told this parable:",
    "10": "<span class=\"wj\">“Two men went up to the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</span>",
    "11": "<span class=\"wj\">The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed, ‘God, I thank You that I am not like the other men—swindlers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.</span>",
    "12": "<span class=\"wj\">I fast twice a week and pay tithes of all that I acquire.'</span>",
    "13": "<span class=\"wj\">But the tax collector stood at a distance, unwilling even to lift up his eyes to heaven. Instead, he beat his breast and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner!'</span>",
    "14": "<span class=\"wj\">I tell you, this man, rather than the Pharisee, went home justified. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”</span>",
    "header_3": "Jesus Blesses the Children",
    "15": "Now people were even bringing their babies to Jesus for Him to place His hands on them. And when the disciples saw this, they rebuked those who brought them.",
    "16": "But Jesus called the children to Him and said, <span class=\"wj\">“Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.</span>",
    "17": "<span class=\"wj\">Truly I tell you, anyone who does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”</span>",
    "header_4": "The Rich Young Ruler",
    "18": "Then a certain ruler asked Him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”",
    "19": "<span class=\"wj\">“Why do you call Me good?”</span> Jesus replied. <span class=\"wj\">“No one is good except God alone.</span>",
    "20": "<span class=\"wj\">You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honor your father and mother.' ”</span>",
    "21": "“All these I have kept from my youth,” he said.",
    "22": "On hearing this, Jesus told him, <span class=\"wj\">“You still lack one thing: Sell everything you own and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me.”</span>",
    "23": "But when the ruler heard this, he became very sad, because he was extremely wealthy.",
    "24": "Seeing the man's sadness, Jesus said, <span class=\"wj\">“How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!</span>",
    "25": "<span class=\"wj\">Indeed, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”</span>",
    "26": "Those who heard this asked, “Who then can be saved?”",
    "27": "But Jesus said, <span class=\"wj\">“What is impossible with man is possible with God.”</span>",
    "28": "“Look,” said Peter, “we have left all we had to follow You.”",
    "29": "<span class=\"wj\">“Truly I tell you,”</span> Jesus replied, <span class=\"wj\">“no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God</span>",
    "30": "<span class=\"wj\">will fail to receive many times more in this age—and in the age to come, eternal life.”</span>",
    "header_5": "The Third Prediction of the Passion",
    "31": "Then Jesus took the Twelve aside and said to them, <span class=\"wj\">“Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything the prophets have written about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.</span>",
    "32": "<span class=\"wj\">He will be delivered over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon.</span>",
    "33": "<span class=\"wj\">They will flog Him and kill Him, and on the third day He will rise again.”</span>",
    "34": "But the disciples did not understand any of these things. The meaning was hidden from them, and they did not comprehend what He was saying.",
    "header_6": "Jesus Heals a Blind Beggar",
    "35": "As Jesus drew near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting beside the road, begging.",
    "36": "When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.",
    "37": "“Jesus of Nazareth is passing by,” they told him.",
    "38": "So he called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”",
    "39": "Those who led the way admonished him to be silent, but he cried out all the louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”",
    "40": "Jesus stopped and directed that the man be brought to Him. When he had been brought near, Jesus asked him,",
    "41": "<span class=\"wj\">“What do you want Me to do for you?”</span> “Lord,” he said, “let me see again.”",
    "42": "<span class=\"wj\">“Receive your sight!”</span> Jesus replied. <span class=\"wj\">“Your faith has healed you.”</span>",
    "43": "Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus, glorifying God. And all the people who saw this gave praise to God."
