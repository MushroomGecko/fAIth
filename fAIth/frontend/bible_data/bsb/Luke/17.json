    "header_1": "Temptations and Trespasses",
    "1": "Jesus said to His disciples, <span class=\"wj\">“It is inevitable that stumbling blocks will come, but woe to the one through whom they come!</span>",
    "2": "<span class=\"wj\">It would be better for him to have a millstone hung around his neck and to be thrown into the sea than to cause one of these little ones to stumble.</span>",
    "3": "<span class=\"wj\">Watch yourselves. If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.</span>",
    "4": "<span class=\"wj\">Even if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times returns to say, ‘I repent,' you must forgive him.”</span>",
    "header_2": "The Power of Faith",
    "5": "The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!”",
    "6": "And the Lord answered, <span class=\"wj\">“If you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it will obey you.</span>",
    "7": "<span class=\"wj\">Which of you whose servant comes in from plowing or shepherding in the field will say to him, ‘Come at once and sit down to eat'?</span>",
    "8": "<span class=\"wj\">Instead, won't he tell him, ‘Prepare my meal and dress yourself to serve me while I eat and drink; and afterward you may eat and drink'?</span>",
    "9": "<span class=\"wj\">Does he thank the servant because he did what he was told?</span>",
    "10": "<span class=\"wj\">So you also, when you have done everything commanded of you, should say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.' ”</span>",
    "header_3": "The Ten Lepers",
    "11": "While Jesus was on His way to Jerusalem, He was passing between Samaria and Galilee.",
    "12": "As He entered one of the villages, He was met by ten lepers. They stood at a distance",
    "13": "and raised their voices, shouting, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”",
    "14": "When Jesus saw them, He said, <span class=\"wj\">“Go, show yourselves to the priests.”</span> And as they were on their way, they were cleansed.",
    "15": "When one of them saw that he was healed, he came back, praising God in a loud voice.",
    "16": "He fell facedown at Jesus' feet in thanksgiving to Him—and he was a Samaritan.",
    "17": "<span class=\"wj\">“Were not all ten cleansed?”</span> Jesus asked. <span class=\"wj\">“Where then are the other nine?</span>",
    "18": "<span class=\"wj\">Was no one found except this foreigner to return and give glory to God?”</span>",
    "19": "Then Jesus said to him, <span class=\"wj\">“Rise and go; your faith has made you well! ”</span>",
    "header_4": "The Coming of the Kingdom",
    "20": "When asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, <span class=\"wj\">“The kingdom of God will not come with observable signs.</span>",
    "21": "<span class=\"wj\">Nor will people say, ‘Look, here it is,' or ‘There it is.' For you see, the kingdom of God is in your midst. ”</span>",
    "22": "Then He said to the disciples, <span class=\"wj\">“The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.</span>",
    "23": "<span class=\"wj\">People will tell you, ‘Look, there He is!' or ‘Look, here He is!' Do not go out or chase after them.</span>",
    "24": "<span class=\"wj\">For just as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other, so will be the Son of Man in His day.</span>",
    "25": "<span class=\"wj\">But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.</span>",
    "26": "<span class=\"wj\">Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man:</span>",
    "27": "<span class=\"wj\">People were eating and drinking, marrying and being given in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.</span>",
    "28": "<span class=\"wj\">It was the same in the days of Lot: People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.</span>",
    "29": "<span class=\"wj\">But on the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.</span>",
    "30": "<span class=\"wj\">It will be just like that on the day the Son of Man is revealed.</span>",
    "31": "<span class=\"wj\">On that day, let no one on the housetop come down to retrieve his possessions. Likewise, let no one in the field return for anything he has left behind.</span>",
    "32": "<span class=\"wj\">Remember Lot's wife!</span>",
    "33": "<span class=\"wj\">Whoever tries to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will preserve it.</span>",
    "34": "<span class=\"wj\">I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed: One will be taken and the other left.</span>",
    "35": "<span class=\"wj\">Two women will be grinding grain together: One will be taken and the other left.”</span>",
    "37": "“Where, Lord?” they asked. Jesus answered, <span class=\"wj\">“Wherever there is a carcass, there the vultures will gather.”</span>"
