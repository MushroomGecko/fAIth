    "1": "Jesus also said to His disciples, <span class=\"wj\">“There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions.</span>",
    "2": "<span class=\"wj\">So he called him in to ask, ‘What is this I hear about you? Turn in an account of your management, for you cannot be manager any longer.'</span>",
    "3": "<span class=\"wj\">The manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do, now that my master is taking away my position? I am too weak to dig and too ashamed to beg.</span>",
    "4": "<span class=\"wj\">I know what I will do, so that after my removal from management, people will welcome me into their homes.'</span>",
    "5": "<span class=\"wj\">And he called in each one of his master's debtors. ‘How much do you owe my master?' he asked the first.</span>",
    "6": "<span class=\"wj\">‘A hundred measures of olive oil,' he answered. ‘Take your bill,' said the manager. ‘Sit down quickly, and write fifty.'</span>",
    "7": "<span class=\"wj\">Then he asked another, ‘And how much do you owe?' ‘A hundred measures of wheat,' he replied. ‘Take your bill and write eighty,' he told him.</span>",
    "8": "<span class=\"wj\">The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the sons of this age are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the sons of light.</span>",
    "9": "<span class=\"wj\">I tell you, use worldly wealth to make friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, they will welcome you into eternal dwellings.</span>",
    "10": "<span class=\"wj\">Whoever is faithful with very little will also be faithful with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.</span>",
    "11": "<span class=\"wj\">So if you have not been faithful with worldly wealth, who will entrust you with true riches?</span>",
    "12": "<span class=\"wj\">And if you have not been faithful with the belongings of another, who will give you belongings of your own?</span>",
    "13": "<span class=\"wj\">No servant can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.”</span>",
    "header_2": "The Law and the Prophets",
    "14": "The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all of this and were scoffing at Jesus.",
    "15": "So He said to them, <span class=\"wj\">“You are the ones who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is prized among men is detestable before God.</span>",
    "16": "<span class=\"wj\">The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John. Since that time, the gospel of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.</span>",
    "17": "<span class=\"wj\">But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for a single stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.</span>",
    "18": "<span class=\"wj\">Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</span>",
    "header_3": "The Rich Man and Lazarus",
    "19": "<span class=\"wj\">Now there was a rich man dressed in purple and fine linen, who lived each day in joyous splendor.</span>",
    "20": "<span class=\"wj\">And a beggar named Lazarus lay at his gate, covered with sores</span>",
    "21": "<span class=\"wj\">and longing to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.</span>",
    "22": "<span class=\"wj\">One day the beggar died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's side. And the rich man also died and was buried.</span>",
    "23": "<span class=\"wj\">In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham from afar, with Lazarus by his side.</span>",
    "24": "<span class=\"wj\">So he cried out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue. For I am in agony in this fire.'</span>",
    "25": "<span class=\"wj\">But Abraham answered, ‘Child, remember that during your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things. But now he is comforted here, while you are in agony.</span>",
    "26": "<span class=\"wj\">And besides all this, a great chasm has been fixed between us and you, so that even those who wish cannot cross from here to you, nor can anyone cross from there to us.'</span>",
    "27": "<span class=\"wj\">‘Then I beg you, father,' he said, ‘send Lazarus to my father's house,</span>",
    "28": "<span class=\"wj\">for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also end up in this place of torment.'</span>",
    "29": "<span class=\"wj\">But Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses and the prophets; let your brothers listen to them.'</span>",
    "30": "<span class=\"wj\">‘No, father Abraham,' he said, ‘but if someone is sent to them from the dead, they will repent.'</span>",
    "31": "<span class=\"wj\">Then Abraham said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead.' ”</span>"
