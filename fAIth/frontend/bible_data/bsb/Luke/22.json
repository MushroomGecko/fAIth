    "6": "Judas consented, and began to look for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them in the absence of a crowd.",

    "7": "Then came the day of Unleavened Bread on which the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed.",
    "8": "Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, <span class=\"wj\">“Go and prepare for us to eat the Passover.”</span>",
    "9": "“Where do You want us to prepare it?” they asked.",
    "10": "He answered, <span class=\"wj\">“When you enter the city, a man carrying a jug of water will meet you. Follow him to the house he enters,</span>",
    "11": "<span class=\"wj\">and say to the owner of that house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?'</span>",

    "21": "<span class=\"wj\">Look! The hand of My betrayer is with Mine on the table.</span>",
    "22": "<span class=\"wj\">Indeed, the Son of Man will go as it has been determined, but woe to that man who betrays Him.”</span>",

    "28": "<span class=\"wj\">You are the ones who have stood by Me in My trials.</span>",
    "29": "<span class=\"wj\">And I bestow on you a kingdom, just as My Father has bestowed one on Me,</span>",

    "33": "“Lord,” said Peter, “I am ready to go with You even to prison and to death.”",
    "34": "But Jesus replied, <span class=\"wj\">“I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me.”</span>",
    "35": "Then Jesus asked them, <span class=\"wj\">“When I sent you out without purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?”</span> “Nothing,” they answered.",
    "36": "<span class=\"wj\">“Now, however,”</span> He told them, <span class=\"wj\">“the one with a purse should take it, and likewise a bag; and the one without a sword should sell his cloak and buy one.</span>",

    "49": "Those around Jesus saw what was about to happen and said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?”",
    "50": "And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.",
    "51": "But Jesus answered, <span class=\"wj\">“No more of this!”</span> And He touched the man's ear and healed him.",
    "52": "Then Jesus said to the chief priests, temple officers, and elders who had come for Him, <span class=\"wj\">“Have you come out with swords and clubs as you would against an outlaw?</span>",

    "56": "A servant girl saw him seated in the firelight and looked intently at him. “This man also was with Him,” she said.",
    "57": "But Peter denied it. “Woman, I do not know Him,” he said.",
    "58": "A short time later, someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not.”",
    "59": "About an hour later, another man insisted, “Certainly this man was with Him, for he too is a Galilean.”",
    "60": "“Man, I do not know what you are talking about,” Peter replied. While he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.",
    "61": "And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word that the Lord had spoken to him: <span class=\"wj\">“Before the rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.”</span>",

    "68": "<span class=\"wj\">And if I ask you a question, you will not answer.</span>",
    "69": "<span class=\"wj\">But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”</span>",
    "70": "So they all asked, “Are You then the Son of God?” He replied, <span class=\"wj\">“You say that I am.”</span>",
    "71": "“Why do we need any more testimony?” they declared. “We have heard it for ourselves from His own lips.”"
