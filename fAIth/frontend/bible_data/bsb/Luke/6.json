    "1": "One Sabbath Jesus was passing through the grainfields, and His disciples began to pick the heads of grain, rub them in their hands, and eat them.",
    "2": "But some of the Pharisees asked, “Why are you doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath?”",
    "3": "Jesus replied, <span class=\"wj\">“Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?</span>",
    "4": "<span class=\"wj\">He entered the house of God, took the consecrated bread and gave it to his companions, and ate what is lawful only for the priests to eat.”</span>",
    "5": "Then Jesus declared, <span class=\"wj\">“The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”</span>",
    "header_2": "Jesus Heals on the Sabbath",
    "6": "On another Sabbath Jesus entered the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there whose right hand was withered.",
    "7": "Looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, the scribes and Pharisees were watching Him closely to see if He would heal on the Sabbath.",
    "8": "But Jesus knew their thoughts and said to the man with the withered hand, <span class=\"wj\">“Get up and stand among us.”</span> So he got up and stood there.",
    "9": "Then Jesus said to them, <span class=\"wj\">“I ask you, which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?”</span>",
    "10": "And after looking around at all of them, He said to the man, <span class=\"wj\">“Stretch out your hand.”</span> He did so, and it was restored.",
    "11": "But the scribes and Pharisees were filled with rage and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.",
    "header_3": "The Twelve Apostles",
    "12": "In those days Jesus went out to the mountain to pray, and He spent the night in prayer to God.",

    "15": "Matthew and Thomas; James son of Alphaeus and Simon called the Zealot;",
    "16": "Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.",
    "header_4": "Jesus Heals the Multitudes",
    "17": "Then Jesus came down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of His disciples was there, along with a great number of people from all over Judea, Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon.",
    "18": "They had come to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases, and those troubled by unclean spirits were healed.",

    "20": "Looking up at His disciples, Jesus said: <span class=\"wj\">“Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.</span>",
    "21": "<span class=\"wj\">Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be filled. Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.</span>",
    "22": "<span class=\"wj\">Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil because of the Son of Man.</span>",
    "23": "<span class=\"wj\">Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. For their fathers treated the prophets in the same way.</span>",
    "header_6": "Woes to the Satisfied",
    "24": "<span class=\"wj\">But woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort.</span>",
    "25": "<span class=\"wj\">Woe to you who are well fed now, for you will hunger. Woe to you who laugh now, for you will mourn and weep.</span>",
    "26": "<span class=\"wj\">Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for their fathers treated the false prophets in the same way.</span>",
    "header_7": "Love Your Enemies",
    "27": "<span class=\"wj\">But to those of you who will listen, I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,</span>",
    "28": "<span class=\"wj\">bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.</span>",
    "29": "<span class=\"wj\">If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also. And if someone takes your cloak, do not withhold your tunic as well.</span>",
    "30": "<span class=\"wj\">Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what is yours, do not demand it back.</span>",
    "31": "<span class=\"wj\">Do to others as you would have them do to you.</span>",
    "32": "<span class=\"wj\">If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners love those who love them.</span>",
    "33": "<span class=\"wj\">If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? Even sinners do the same.</span>",
    "34": "<span class=\"wj\">And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, expecting to be repaid in full.</span>",
    "35": "<span class=\"wj\">But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them, expecting nothing in return. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for He is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.</span>",
    "36": "<span class=\"wj\">Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.</span>",
    "header_8": "Judging Others",
    "37": "<span class=\"wj\">Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.</span>",
    "38": "<span class=\"wj\">Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you.”</span>",
    "39": "Jesus also told them a parable: <span class=\"wj\">“Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?</span>",
    "40": "<span class=\"wj\">A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher.</span>",
    "41": "<span class=\"wj\">Why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but fail to notice the beam in your own eye?</span>",
    "42": "<span class=\"wj\">How can you say, ‘Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,' while you yourself fail to see the beam in your own eye? You hypocrite! First take the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.</span>",
    "header_9": "A Tree and Its Fruit",
    "43": "<span class=\"wj\">No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.</span>",
    "44": "<span class=\"wj\">For each tree is known by its own fruit. Indeed, figs are not gathered from thornbushes, nor grapes from brambles.</span>",
    "45": "<span class=\"wj\">The good man brings good things out of the good treasure of his heart, and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil treasure of his heart. For out of the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks.</span>",
    "header_10": "The House on the Rock",
    "46": "<span class=\"wj\">Why do you call Me ‘Lord, Lord,' but not do what I say?</span>",
    "47": "<span class=\"wj\">I will show you what he is like who comes to Me and hears My words and acts on them:</span>",
    "48": "<span class=\"wj\">He is like a man building a house, who dug down deep and laid his foundation on the rock. When the flood came, the torrent crashed against that house but could not shake it, because it was well built.</span>",
    "49": "<span class=\"wj\">But the one who hears My words and does not act on them is like a man who built his house on ground without a foundation. The torrent crashed against that house, and immediately it fell—and great was its destruction!”</span>"
