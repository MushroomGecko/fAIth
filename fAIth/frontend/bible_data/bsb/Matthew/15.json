    "header_1": "The Tradition of the Elders",
    "1": "Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked,",
    "2": "“Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They do not wash their hands before they eat.”",
    "3": "Jesus replied, <span class=\"wj\">“And why do you break the command of God for the sake of your tradition?</span>",
    "4": "<span class=\"wj\">For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother' and ‘Anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death.'</span>",
    "5": "<span class=\"wj\">But you say that if anyone says to his father or mother, ‘Whatever you would have received from me is a gift devoted to God,'</span>",
    "6": "<span class=\"wj\">he need not honor his father or mother with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.</span>",
    "7": "<span class=\"wj\">You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you:</span>",
    "8": "<span class=\"wj\">‘These people honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me.</span>",
    "9": "<span class=\"wj\">They worship Me in vain; they teach as doctrine the precepts of men.' ”</span>",
    "header_2": "What Defiles a Man",
    "10": "Jesus called the crowd to Him and said, <span class=\"wj\">“Listen and understand.</span>",
    "11": "<span class=\"wj\">A man is not defiled by what enters his mouth, but by what comes out of it.”</span>",
    "12": "Then the disciples came to Him and said, “Are You aware that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?”",
    "13": "But Jesus replied, <span class=\"wj\">“Every plant that My heavenly Father has not planted will be pulled up by its roots.</span>",
    "14": "<span class=\"wj\">Disregard them! They are blind guides. If a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.”</span>",
    "15": "Peter said to Him, “Explain this parable to us.”",
    "16": "<span class=\"wj\">“Do you still not understand?”</span> Jesus asked.",
    "17": "<span class=\"wj\">“Do you not yet realize that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then is eliminated?</span>",
    "18": "<span class=\"wj\">But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these things defile a man.</span>",
    "19": "<span class=\"wj\">For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, and slander.</span>",
    "20": "<span class=\"wj\">These are what defile a man, but eating with unwashed hands does not defile him.”</span>",
    "header_3": "The Faith of the Canaanite Woman",
    "21": "Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon.",
    "22": "And a Canaanite woman from that region came to Him, crying out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is miserably possessed by a demon.”",
    "23": "But Jesus did not answer a word. So His disciples came and urged Him, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.”",
    "24": "He answered, <span class=\"wj\">“I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”</span>",
    "25": "The woman came and knelt before Him. “Lord, help me!” she said.",
    "26": "But Jesus replied, <span class=\"wj\">“It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs.”</span>",
    "27": "“Yes, Lord,” she said, “even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table.”",
    "28": "<span class=\"wj\">“O woman,”</span> Jesus answered, <span class=\"wj\">“your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you desire.”</span> And her daughter was healed from that very hour.",
    "header_4": "The Feeding of the Four Thousand",
    "29": "Moving on from there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee. Then He went up on a mountain and sat down.",
    "30": "Large crowds came to Him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and laid them at His feet, and He healed them.",
    "31": "The crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled restored, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.",
    "32": "Then Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, <span class=\"wj\">“I have compassion for this crowd, because they have already been with Me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may faint along the way.”</span>",
    "33": "The disciples replied, “Where in this desolate place could we find enough bread to feed such a large crowd?”",
    "34": "<span class=\"wj\">“How many loaves do you have?”</span> Jesus asked. “Seven,” they replied, “and a few small fish.”",
    "35": "And He instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground.",
    "36": "Taking the seven loaves and the fish, He gave thanks and broke them. Then He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.",
    "37": "They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.",
    "38": "A total of four thousand men were fed, in addition to women and children.",
    "39": "After Jesus had dismissed the crowds, He got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan."
