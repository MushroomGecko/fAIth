    "header_1": "Judging Others",
    "1": "<span class=\"wj\">“Do not judge, or you will be judged.</span>",
    "2": "<span class=\"wj\">For with the same judgment you pronounce, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.</span>",
    "3": "<span class=\"wj\">Why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but fail to notice the beam in your own eye?</span>",
    "4": "<span class=\"wj\">How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,' while there is still a beam in your own eye?</span>",
    "5": "<span class=\"wj\">You hypocrite! First take the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.</span>",
    "6": "<span class=\"wj\">Do not give dogs what is holy; do not throw your pearls before swine. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and then turn and tear you to pieces.</span>",
    "header_2": "Ask, Seek, Knock",
    "7": "<span class=\"wj\">Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.</span>",
    "8": "<span class=\"wj\">For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.</span>",
    "9": "<span class=\"wj\">Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?</span>",
    "10": "<span class=\"wj\">Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?</span>",
    "11": "<span class=\"wj\">So if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!</span>",
    "12": "<span class=\"wj\">In everything, then, do to others as you would have them do to you. For this is the essence of the Law and the Prophets.</span>",
    "header_3": "The Narrow Gate",
    "13": "<span class=\"wj\">Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.</span>",
    "14": "<span class=\"wj\">But small is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life, and only a few find it.</span>",
    "header_4": "A Tree and Its Fruit",
    "15": "<span class=\"wj\">Beware of false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.</span>",
    "16": "<span class=\"wj\">By their fruit you will recognize them. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?</span>",
    "17": "<span class=\"wj\">Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.</span>",
    "18": "<span class=\"wj\">A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.</span>",
    "19": "<span class=\"wj\">Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</span>",
    "20": "<span class=\"wj\">So then, by their fruit you will recognize them.</span>",
    "21": "<span class=\"wj\">Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of My Father in heaven.</span>",
    "22": "<span class=\"wj\">Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?'</span>",
    "23": "<span class=\"wj\">Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness!'</span>",
    "header_5": "The House on the Rock",
    "24": "<span class=\"wj\">Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.</span>",
    "25": "<span class=\"wj\">The rain fell, the torrents raged, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because its foundation was on the rock.</span>",
    "26": "<span class=\"wj\">But everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.</span>",
    "27": "<span class=\"wj\">The rain fell, the torrents raged, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell—and great was its collapse!”</span>",
    "header_6": "The Authority of Jesus",
    "28": "When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were astonished at His teaching,",
    "29": "because He taught as one who had authority, and not as their scribes."
