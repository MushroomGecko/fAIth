    "4": "<span class=\"wj\">He entered the house of God, and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread, which was not lawful for them to eat, but only for the priests.</span>",
    "5": "<span class=\"wj\">Or haven't you read in the Law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple break the Sabbath and yet are innocent?</span>",
    "6": "<span class=\"wj\">But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here.</span>",
    "7": "<span class=\"wj\">If only you had known the meaning of ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the innocent.</span>",

    "11": "He replied, <span class=\"wj\">“If one of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will he not take hold of it and lift it out?</span>",
    "12": "<span class=\"wj\">How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.”</span>",
    "13": "Then Jesus said to the man, <span class=\"wj\">“Stretch out your hand.”</span> So he stretched it out, and it was restored to full use, just like the other.",
