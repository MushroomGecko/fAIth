    "1": "And calling His twelve disciples to Him, Jesus gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they could drive them out and heal every disease and sickness.",
    "2": "These are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon, called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John;",
    "3": "Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;",
    "4": "Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus.",
    "header_2": "The Ministry of the Twelve",
    "5": "These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: <span class=\"wj\">“Do not go onto the road of the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.</span>",
    "6": "<span class=\"wj\">Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel.</span>",
    "7": "<span class=\"wj\">As you go, preach this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven is near.'</span>",
    "8": "<span class=\"wj\">Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.</span>",
    "9": "<span class=\"wj\">Do not carry any gold or silver or copper in your belts.</span>",
    "10": "<span class=\"wj\">Take no bag for the road, or second tunic, or sandals, or staff; for the worker is worthy of his provisions.</span>",
    "11": "<span class=\"wj\">Whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy there and stay at his house until you move on.</span>",
    "12": "<span class=\"wj\">As you enter the home, greet its occupants.</span>",
    "13": "<span class=\"wj\">If the home is worthy, let your peace rest on it; but if it is not, let your peace return to you.</span>",
    "14": "<span class=\"wj\">And if anyone will not welcome you or heed your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town.</span>",
    "15": "<span class=\"wj\">Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.</span>",
    "header_3": "Sheep among Wolves",
    "16": "<span class=\"wj\">Behold, I am sending you out like sheep among wolves; therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.</span>",
    "17": "<span class=\"wj\">But beware of men; for they will hand you over to their councils and flog you in their synagogues.</span>",
    "18": "<span class=\"wj\">On My account, you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.</span>",
    "19": "<span class=\"wj\">But when they hand you over, do not worry about how to respond or what to say. In that hour you will be given what to say.</span>",
    "20": "<span class=\"wj\">For it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.</span>",
    "21": "<span class=\"wj\">Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rise against their parents and have them put to death.</span>",
    "22": "<span class=\"wj\">You will be hated by everyone because of My name, but the one who perseveres to the end will be saved.</span>",
    "23": "<span class=\"wj\">When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next. Truly I tell you, you will not reach all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.</span>",
    "24": "<span class=\"wj\">A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.</span>",
    "25": "<span class=\"wj\">It is enough for a disciple to be like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household!</span>",
    "header_4": "Fear God Alone",
    "26": "<span class=\"wj\">So do not be afraid of them. For there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, and nothing hidden that will not be made known.</span>",
    "27": "<span class=\"wj\">What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the housetops.</span>",
    "28": "<span class=\"wj\">Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Instead, fear the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.</span>",
    "29": "<span class=\"wj\">Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father.</span>",
    "30": "<span class=\"wj\">And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</span>",
    "31": "<span class=\"wj\">So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.</span>",
    "header_5": "Confessing Christ",
    "32": "<span class=\"wj\">Therefore everyone who confesses Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father in heaven.</span>",
    "33": "<span class=\"wj\">But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father in heaven.</span>",
    "header_6": "Not Peace but a Sword",
    "34": "<span class=\"wj\">Do not assume that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.</span>",
    "35": "<span class=\"wj\">For I have come to turn ‘a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.</span>",
    "36": "<span class=\"wj\">A man's enemies will be the members of his own household.'</span>",
    "37": "<span class=\"wj\">Anyone who loves his father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; anyone who loves his son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me;</span>",
    "38": "<span class=\"wj\">and anyone who does not take up his cross and follow Me is not worthy of Me.</span>",
    "39": "<span class=\"wj\">Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.</span>",
    "header_7": "The Reward of Service",
    "40": "<span class=\"wj\">He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives the One who sent Me.</span>",
    "41": "<span class=\"wj\">Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and whoever receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward.</span>",
    "42": "<span class=\"wj\">And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is My disciple, truly I tell you, he will never lose his reward.”</span>"
