    "1": "But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.",
    "2": "Early in the morning He went back into the temple courts. All the people came to Him, and He sat down to teach them.",
    "3": "The scribes and Pharisees, however, brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before them",
    "4": "and said, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.",
    "5": "In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such a woman. So what do You say?”",
    "6": "They said this to test Him, in order to have a basis for accusing Him. But Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with His finger.",
    "7": "When they continued to question Him, He straightened up and said to them, <span class=\"wj\">“Let him who is without sin among you be the first to cast a stone at her.”</span>",
    "8": "And again He bent down and wrote on the ground.",
    "9": "When they heard this, they began to go away one by one, beginning with the older ones, until only Jesus was left, with the woman standing there.",
    "10": "Then Jesus straightened up and asked her, <span class=\"wj\">“Woman, where are your accusers? Has no one condemned you?”</span>",
    "11": "“No one, Lord,” she answered. <span class=\"wj\">“Then neither do I condemn you,”</span> Jesus declared. <span class=\"wj\">“Now go and sin no more.”</span>",
    "header_2": "Jesus the Light of the World",
    "12": "Once again, Jesus spoke to the people and said, <span class=\"wj\">“I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me will never walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.”</span>",
    "13": "So the Pharisees said to Him, “You are testifying about Yourself; Your testimony is not valid.”",
    "14": "Jesus replied, <span class=\"wj\">“Even if I testify about Myself, My testimony is valid, because I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I came from or where I am going.</span>",
    "15": "<span class=\"wj\">You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.</span>",
    "16": "<span class=\"wj\">But even if I do judge, My judgment is true, because I am not alone; I am with the Father who sent Me.</span>",
    "17": "<span class=\"wj\">Even in your own Law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid.</span>",
    "18": "<span class=\"wj\">I am One who testifies about Myself, and the Father, who sent Me, also testifies about Me.”</span>",
    "19": "“Where is Your Father?” they asked Him. <span class=\"wj\">“You do not know Me or My Father,”</span> Jesus answered. <span class=\"wj\">“If you knew Me, you would know My Father as well.”</span>",
    "20": "He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts, near the treasury. Yet no one seized Him, because His hour had not yet come.",
    "21": "Again He said to them, <span class=\"wj\">“I am going away, and you will look for Me, but you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.”</span>",
    "22": "So the Jews began to ask, “Will He kill Himself, since He says, <span class=\"wj\">‘Where I am going, you cannot come'</span> ?”",
    "23": "Then He told them, <span class=\"wj\">“You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.</span>",
    "24": "<span class=\"wj\">That is why I told you that you would die in your sins. For unless you believe that I am He, you will die in your sins.”</span>",
    "25": "“Who are You?” they asked. <span class=\"wj\">“Just what I have been telling you from the beginning,”</span> Jesus replied.",
    "26": "<span class=\"wj\">“I have much to say about you and much to judge. But the One who sent Me is truthful, and what I have heard from Him, I tell the world.”</span>",
    "27": "They did not understand that He was telling them about the Father.",
    "28": "So Jesus said, <span class=\"wj\">“When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He, and that I do nothing on My own, but speak exactly what the Father has taught Me.</span>",
    "29": "<span class=\"wj\">He who sent Me is with Me. He has not left Me alone, because I always do what pleases Him.”</span>",
    "header_3": "The Truth Will Set You Free",
    "30": "As Jesus spoke these things, many believed in Him.",
    "31": "So He said to the Jews who had believed Him, <span class=\"wj\">“If you continue in My word, you are truly My disciples.</span>",
    "32": "<span class=\"wj\">Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</span>",
    "33": "“We are Abraham's descendants,” they answered. “We have never been slaves to anyone. How can You say we will be set free?”",
    "34": "Jesus replied, <span class=\"wj\">“Truly, truly, I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.</span>",
    "35": "<span class=\"wj\">A slave is not a permanent member of the family, but a son belongs to it forever.</span>",
    "36": "<span class=\"wj\">So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.</span>",
    "37": "<span class=\"wj\">I know you are Abraham's descendants, but you are trying to kill Me because My word has no place within you.</span>",
    "38": "<span class=\"wj\">I speak of what I have seen in the presence of the Father, and you do what you have heard from your father.”</span>",
    "39": "“Abraham is our father,” they replied. <span class=\"wj\">“If you were children of Abraham,”</span> said Jesus, <span class=\"wj\">“you would do the works of Abraham.</span>",
    "40": "<span class=\"wj\">But now you are trying to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham never did such a thing.</span>",
    "41": "<span class=\"wj\">You are doing the works of your father.”</span> “We are not illegitimate children,” they declared. “Our only Father is God Himself.”",
    "42": "Jesus said to them, <span class=\"wj\">“If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on My own, but He sent Me.</span>",
    "43": "<span class=\"wj\">Why do you not understand what I am saying? It is because you are unable to accept My message.</span>",
    "44": "<span class=\"wj\">You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out his desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, refusing to uphold the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, because he is a liar and the father of lies.</span>",
    "45": "<span class=\"wj\">But because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me!</span>",
    "46": "<span class=\"wj\">Which of you can prove Me guilty of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe Me?</span>",
    "47": "<span class=\"wj\">Whoever belongs to God hears the words of God. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.”</span>",
    "header_4": "Before Abraham Was Born, I Am",
    "48": "The Jews answered Him, “Are we not right to say that You are a Samaritan and You have a demon?”",
    "49": "<span class=\"wj\">“I do not have a demon,”</span> Jesus replied, <span class=\"wj\">“but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.</span>",
    "50": "<span class=\"wj\">I do not seek My own glory. There is One who seeks it, and He is the Judge.</span>",
    "51": "<span class=\"wj\">Truly, truly, I tell you, if anyone keeps My word, he will never see death.”</span>",
    "52": "“Now we know that You have a demon!” declared the Jews. “Abraham died, and so did the prophets, yet You say that anyone who keeps Your word will never taste death.",
    "53": "Are You greater than our father Abraham? He died, as did the prophets. Who do You claim to be?”",
    "54": "Jesus answered, <span class=\"wj\">“If I glorify Myself, My glory means nothing. The One who glorifies Me is My Father, of whom you say ‘He is our God.'</span>",
    "55": "<span class=\"wj\">You do not know Him, but I know Him. If I said I did not know Him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know Him, and I keep His word.</span>",
    "56": "<span class=\"wj\">Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see My day. He saw it and was glad.”</span>",
    "57": "Then the Jews said to Him, “You are not yet fifty years old, and You have seen Abraham?”",
    "58": "<span class=\"wj\">“Truly, truly, I tell you,”</span> Jesus declared, <span class=\"wj\">“before Abraham was born, I am! ”</span>",
    "59": "At this, they picked up stones to throw at Him. But Jesus was hidden and went out of the temple area."
