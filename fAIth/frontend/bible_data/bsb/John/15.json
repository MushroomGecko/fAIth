    "1": "<span class=\"wj\">“I am the true vine, and My Father is the keeper of the vineyard.</span>",
    "2": "<span class=\"wj\">He cuts off every branch in Me that bears no fruit, and every branch that does bear fruit, He prunes to make it even more fruitful.</span>",
    "3": "<span class=\"wj\">You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.</span>",
    "4": "<span class=\"wj\">Remain in Me, and I will remain in you. Just as no branch can bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in Me.</span>",
    "5": "<span class=\"wj\">I am the vine and you are the branches. The one who remains in Me, and I in him, will bear much fruit. For apart from Me you can do nothing.</span>",
    "6": "<span class=\"wj\">If anyone does not remain in Me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers. Such branches are gathered up, thrown into the fire, and burned.</span>",
    "7": "<span class=\"wj\">If you remain in Me and My words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.</span>",
    "8": "<span class=\"wj\">This is to My Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, proving yourselves to be My disciples.</span>",
    "header_2": "No Greater Love",
    "9": "<span class=\"wj\">As the Father has loved Me, so have I loved you. Remain in My love.</span>",
    "10": "<span class=\"wj\">If you keep My commandments, you will remain in My love, just as I have kept My Father's commandments and remain in His love.</span>",
    "11": "<span class=\"wj\">I have told you these things so that My joy may be in you and your joy may be complete.</span>",
    "12": "<span class=\"wj\">This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.</span>",
    "13": "<span class=\"wj\">Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.</span>",
    "14": "<span class=\"wj\">You are My friends if you do what I command you.</span>",
    "15": "<span class=\"wj\">No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not understand what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, because everything I have learned from My Father I have made known to you.</span>",
    "16": "<span class=\"wj\">You did not choose Me, but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit—fruit that will remain—so that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He will give you.</span>",
    "17": "<span class=\"wj\">This is My command to you: Love one another.</span>",
    "header_3": "The Hatred of the World",
    "18": "<span class=\"wj\">If the world hates you, understand that it hated Me first.</span>",
    "19": "<span class=\"wj\">If you were of the world, it would love you as its own. Instead, the world hates you, because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world.</span>",
    "20": "<span class=\"wj\">Remember the word that I spoke to you: ‘No servant is greater than his master.' If they persecuted Me, they will persecute you as well; if they kept My word, they will keep yours as well.</span>",
    "21": "<span class=\"wj\">But they will treat you like this because of My name, since they do not know the One who sent Me.</span>",
    "22": "<span class=\"wj\">If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin.</span>",
    "23": "<span class=\"wj\">Whoever hates Me hates My Father as well.</span>",
    "24": "<span class=\"wj\">If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have seen and hated both Me and My Father.</span>",
    "25": "<span class=\"wj\">But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: ‘They hated Me without reason.'</span>",
    "26": "<span class=\"wj\">When the Advocate comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father—He will testify about Me.</span>",
    "27": "<span class=\"wj\">And you also must testify, because you have been with Me from the beginning.</span>"
