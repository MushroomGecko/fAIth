    "header_1": "The Parable of the Sower",
    "1": "Once again Jesus began to teach beside the sea, and such a large crowd gathered around Him that He got into a boat and sat in it, while all the people crowded along the shore.",
    "2": "And He taught them many things in parables, and in His teaching He said,",
    "3": "<span class=\"wj\">“Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed.</span>",
    "4": "<span class=\"wj\">And as he was sowing, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.</span>",
    "5": "<span class=\"wj\">Some fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow.</span>",
    "6": "<span class=\"wj\">But when the sun rose, the seedlings were scorched, and they withered because they had no root.</span>",
    "7": "<span class=\"wj\">Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the seedlings, and they yielded no crop.</span>",
    "8": "<span class=\"wj\">Still other seed fell on good soil, where it sprouted, grew up, and produced a crop—one bearing thirtyfold, another sixtyfold, and another a hundredfold.”</span>",
    "9": "Then Jesus said, <span class=\"wj\">“He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”</span>",
    "header_2": "The Purpose of Jesus' Parables",
    "10": "As soon as Jesus was alone with the Twelve and those around Him, they asked Him about the parable.",
    "11": "He replied, <span class=\"wj\">“The mystery of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to those on the outside everything is expressed in parables,</span>",
    "12": "<span class=\"wj\">so that, ‘they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven.' ”</span>",
    "header_3": "The Parable of the Sower Explained",
    "13": "Then Jesus said to them, <span class=\"wj\">“Do you not understand this parable? Then how will you understand any of the parables?</span>",
    "14": "<span class=\"wj\">The farmer sows the word.</span>",
    "15": "<span class=\"wj\">Some are like the seeds along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.</span>",
    "16": "<span class=\"wj\">Some are like the seeds sown on rocky ground. They hear the word and at once receive it with joy.</span>",
    "17": "<span class=\"wj\">But they themselves have no root, and they remain for only a season. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away.</span>",
    "18": "<span class=\"wj\">Others are like the seeds sown among the thorns. They hear the word,</span>",
    "19": "<span class=\"wj\">but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth, and the desire for other things come in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</span>",
    "20": "<span class=\"wj\">Still others are like the seeds sown on good soil. They hear the word, receive it, and produce a crop—thirtyfold, sixtyfold, or a hundredfold.”</span>",
    "header_4": "The Lesson of the Lamp",
    "21": "Jesus also said to them, <span class=\"wj\">“Does anyone bring in a lamp to put it under a basket or under a bed? Doesn't he set it on a stand?</span>",
    "22": "<span class=\"wj\">For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be brought to light.</span>",
    "23": "<span class=\"wj\">If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.”</span>",
    "24": "He went on to say, <span class=\"wj\">“Pay attention to what you hear. With the measure you use, it will be measured to you, and even more will be added to you.</span>",
    "25": "<span class=\"wj\">For whoever has will be given more. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.”</span>",
    "header_5": "The Seed Growing Secretly",
    "26": "Jesus also said, <span class=\"wj\">“The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seed on the ground.</span>",
    "27": "<span class=\"wj\">Night and day he sleeps and wakes, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he knows not how.</span>",
    "28": "<span class=\"wj\">All by itself the earth produces a crop—first the stalk, then the head, then grain that ripens within.</span>",
    "29": "<span class=\"wj\">And as soon as the grain is ripe, he swings the sickle, because the harvest has come. ”</span>",
    "header_6": "The Parable of the Mustard Seed",
    "30": "Then He asked, <span class=\"wj\">“To what can we compare the kingdom of God? With what parable shall we present it?</span>",
    "31": "<span class=\"wj\">It is like a mustard seed, which is the smallest of all seeds sown upon the earth.</span>",
    "32": "<span class=\"wj\">But after it is planted, it grows to be the largest of all garden plants and puts forth great branches, so that the birds of the air nest in its shade.”</span>",
    "33": "With many such parables Jesus spoke the word to them, to the extent that they could understand.",
    "34": "He did not tell them anything without using a parable. But privately He explained everything to His own disciples.",
    "header_7": "Jesus Calms the Storm",
    "35": "When that evening came, He said to His disciples, <span class=\"wj\">“Let us cross to the other side.”</span>",
    "36": "After they had dismissed the crowd, they took Jesus with them, since He was already in the boat. And there were other boats with Him.",
    "37": "Soon a violent windstorm came up, and the waves were breaking over the boat, so that it was being swamped.",
    "38": "But Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on the cushion. So they woke Him and said, “Teacher, don't You care that we are perishing?”",
    "39": "Then Jesus got up and rebuked the wind and the sea. <span class=\"wj\">“Silence!”</span> He commanded. <span class=\"wj\">“Be still!”</span> And the wind died down, and it was perfectly calm.",
    "40": "<span class=\"wj\">“Why are you so afraid?”</span> He asked. <span class=\"wj\">“Do you still have no faith?”</span>",
    "41": "Overwhelmed with fear, they asked one another, “Who is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?”"
